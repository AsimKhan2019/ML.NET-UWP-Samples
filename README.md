# UWP-MachineLearning-Sample
Demonstrates how to use ML.NET and Oxyplot to implement some Machine Learning use cases in an MVVM UWP app. Currently works against ML.NET v1.3.1 and is tested against v1.4.0-preview. 

If you want to see these same ML.NET scenarios in Jupyter Notebooks and XPlot, then visit https://github.com/XamlBrewer/ML.NET-Jupyter-Notebooks.

## Look mom, no Python
The UWP app demonstrates the following Machine Learning scenarios:
* Clustering
* Multiclass Classification
* Binary Classification
* Regression
* Feature Contribution Calculation
* Permutation Feature Importance Calculation
* Recommendation
* Recommendation using Field-Aware Factorization Machine
* Automated model generation with AutoML
* Feature Distribution Analysis with Boxplot Diagrams
* Feature Correlation Analysis with Heatmap Diagrams
