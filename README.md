# UWP-MachineLearning-Sample
Demonstrates how to use ML.NET and Oxyplot to implement some Machine Learning use cases in an MVVM UWP app. Currently works against ML.NET v1.3.1 and is tested against v1.4.0-preview.

## Look mom, no Python
The UWP app demonstrates the following Machine Learning scenarios:
* Clustering
* Multiclass Classification
* Binary Classification
* Regression
* Feature Contribution Calculation (under construction)
* Recommendation
* Recommendation using Field-Aware Factorization Machine
* Automated model generation with AutoML
* Feature Distribution Analysis with Boxplot Diagrams
* Feature Correlation Analysis with Heatmap Diagrams

## Seeing is believing
